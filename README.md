# Welcome to My GitHub Page

Hello and thank you for visiting my GitHub profile. I’m Eshaa Sumesh — a cybersecurity student and aspiring security researcher passionate about building secure systems using modern technologies such as blockchain, Zero Trust architecture and cryptographic protocols. I also enjoy exploring web development frameworks and applying machine learning in cybersecurity.

## About Me

- Cybersecurity student with a deep interest in system and network security
- Hands-on experience in building blockchain-based financial and image protection solutions
- Contributor to security-focused web applications implementing Zero Trust principles
- Active participant in Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions and cybersecurity hackathons
- Currently learning cyber forensics, advanced blockchain development, and applied cryptography
- Improving coding proficiency through regular practice on LeetCode and HackerRank
- Interested in collaborating on projects related to Zero Trust security, blockchain, and ML in security

## Projects Developed

### Zero Trust Blockchain Finance Application 
A financial web application developed using Flask and Ethereum (Ganache) to implement Zero Trust security:  
- Smart contract handles Ether transactions with digital signature verification  
- OTP generation and transaction confirmation system  
- Tracks and logs every transaction with detailed metrics (gas usage, time taken)  
- Implements cryptographic verification before fund transfer  


### Speech Disorder Detection Web Application  
A diagnostic tool built with Flask and Librosa for analyzing stammering in real-time:  
- Records user speech and applies signal processing to identify patterns  
- Stores speech data and analysis results in a MySQL database  
- Visualizes progress over time through graphical reports  

### Women Empowerment Mobile App - *EmpowHer*  
An Android app built in Kotlin to connect women to resources and support networks:  
- Features include SOS alerts, learning modules, and a safe space forum  
- Integrated real-time notifications and local authority contact features  

### IoT Smart Railway Accident Avert System  
An embedded system for train-track collision prevention:  
- Sensors deployed to detect obstructions and notify central control  
- Real-time data relay via GSM module to avert potential collisions  

### Capture the Flag (CTF) Participation  
Actively participating in picoCTF and team-based CTF challenges, focusing on:  
- Cryptography  
- Web Exploitation  
- Binary Exploitation  
- Forensics
